## Topic: 

For this discussion you will be researching object-oriented programming, specifically with creating methods.  For the initial post, discuss how using methods would be beneficial when working in a team of programmers.  Give several benefits as well as provide justifications for these benefits.  For the response post, chose a post from one of your classmates and discuss a possible downside to one of the benefits they have chosen.  Be sure to be in depth and justify your posts.

## Response:

Object Oriented Programming is a paradigm of programing that has been very widely used for a very long time. That is simply one of the best reasons to use it.

Because it has been around for so long people have written so much and taken the paradigm in fascinating directions there is plentiful amounts of documentation that already exists and use it in your own projects. 

Another advantage that OOP provides is that you can debug a lot easier (given that you are following OOP principles correctly). Because methods are locked to objects it becomes much easier to discover what is causing the issue in your code by following the stack.

My final reason to use OOP is because of how beautifully it can fit with DataBases. DataBases are great ways to store data and most modern OOP languages allow you to pull data out using SQL and cast that data to objects to better fit into the backend of an application. This alone can make it OOP worth it for a lot of projects.
