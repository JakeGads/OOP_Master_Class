<!-- For this discussion you will be researching repetition structures, also known as loops.  There are several different types of loops, such as while, for, do-while, etc.  For the initial post, imagine you will be creating a loop to run a specific number of times.  Choose one of the loop methods to utilize and justify why you have chosen that method.  For the response post, take a classmates post and give a possible issue that would arise with the method they have chosen.  Be sure to be in depth and justify your posts. -->
