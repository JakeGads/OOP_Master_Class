For the response post, choose one of your classmates posts and discuss a possible downside to one of the benefits they mentioned.  Be sure to be in depth and support your posts with justifications.

Response:

Polymorphism is great, it can save time when you are developing if two things can exist in the same inheritance line for instance, a doctor is a person but so is a student hence we can have an inheritance line of 

```bash
            Doctor
        /
Person
        \
            Student
```

where person can hold methods that both doctor and student which means you just have to write those methods once instead of twice.
